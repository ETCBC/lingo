100000	Everything
about
us,
everything
around
us,
everything
we
know
and
can
know
is
composed
ultimately
of
patterns
of
nothing;
thatâ€™s
the
bottom
line,
the
final
truth.
So
where
we
find
we
have
any
control
over
those
patterns,
why
not
make
the
most
elegant
ones,
the
most
enjoyable
and
good
ones,
in
our
own
terms?
