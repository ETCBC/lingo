    "# Getting Heads 😶\n",
    "## By Cody Kingham, in collaboration with Christiaan Erwich\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "The ETCBC's BHSA core data does not contain the standard syntax tree format. This also means that syntactic and functional relationships between individual words are not mapped in a transparent or easily accessible way. In some cases, fine-grained relationships are ignored altogether. For example, for a given noun phrase (NP), there is no explicit way of obtaining its head noun (i.e. the noun itself without any modifying elements). This causes numerous problems for research in the realm of semantics. For instance, it is currently very difficult to calculate the complete person, gender, and number (PGN) of a given subject phrase. That is because PGN is stored at the word level only. But this is a very inadequate representation. Phrases in the ETCBC often contain coordinate relationships within the phrase. So even if one selects the first \"noun\" in the phrase and checks for its PGN value, they may overlook the presence of another noun which makes the phrase plural. Ideally, the phrase itself would have a PGN feature. But before this kind of data is created, it is necessary to separate the head words of a phrase from their modifying elements such as adjectives, determiners, or nouns in construct (genitive) relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A head word can be defined as the word for which a phrase type is named after. A phrase type can be NP for noun phrase or VP for verb phrase. In this notebook, we experiment with and build the functions stored in `heads.py` in order to export a set of Text-Fabric edge features. The edge features represent a mapping from a phrase node to its head element. \n",
    "\n",
    "This goal requires us to think carefully about the way inter-word, semantic relations are reflected in the ETCBC's data. The ETCBC *does* contain some rudimentary semantic embeddings through the so-called [subphrase](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/features/hebrew/c/otype). These can be utilized to isolate head words from secondary elements. A subphrase should *not* be thought of as a smaller, embedded phrase, like the ETCBC's phrase-atom (though it sometimes must indadequately fill that role). Rather, the subphrase is a way to encode relationships between words below the level of a phrase(atom), hence \"sub.\" A subphrase can be a single word, or it can be a collection of words. A word can be in multiple subphrases, but can not be in more than 3 (due to the limitations of the data creation program, [parsephrases](http://www.etcbc.nl/datacreation/#ps3.p)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "The types of phrases represented in the ETCBC include `NP` (noun phrase), `VP` (verb phrase), `PrNP` (proper noun phrase), `PP` (prepositional phrase), `AdvP` (adverbial phrase), and [eight others](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/features/hebrew/c/typ). For some of these types, isolating the head word is a simple affair. By coordinating a word's phrase-dependent part of speech with its enclosing phrase's type, one can identify the head word. For a `VP`, that would mean simply finding the word within the phrase that has a `pdp` (phrase dependent part of speech) value of `verb`. Or for a prepositional phrase, find the word with a `pdp` of `prep`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NP` and `PrNP`, on the other hand, present special challenges. These phrases often contain multiple words with a modifying relation to the head noun. An example of this is the construct relation (e.g. \"Son of Jacob\"). The problem becomes particularly thorny when relations like the construct are chained together so that one is faced with the choice between multiple potential head nouns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To navigate the problem, we must use the feature [rela (relationship)](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/features/hebrew/c/rela) stored on `subphrase`s in addition to the `pdp` and phrase `type` features. In order to isolate the head word of a `NP`, we look for a word within the phrase that has a `pdp` value of `subs` (i.e. noun). We then obtain a list of all the `subphrase`s which contain that word using the [L.u Text-Fabric method](https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric/wiki/Api#locality). We then use the list of subphrase node numbers to create a list of all subphrase relations containing the word. If the list contains *any* dependent relations, then the word is automatically excluded from being a head word and we can move on to the next candidate. One final check is required for candidate words at the level of the `phrase`: the same procedure described above for `subphrase`s must be performed for `phrase_atom` relations. This means excluding words within a `phrase_atom` with a dependent relation to another `phrase_atom` within the `phrase`. If the head of a *`phrase_atom`* is being calculated, this step is not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two possible `subphrase` or `phrase_atom` relations for a valid head word: `NA` or `par`/`Para`. `NA` means that no relation is reflected. The word is independent. The `par` (`subphrase`) and `Para` (`phrase_atom`) stands for parallel relations, i.e. coordinates. These words require one further test, that is, it must be verified that their mother (using the [edge feature](https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric/wiki/Api#edge-features) \"[mother](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/features/hebrew/c/mother.html)\") is itself a head word. To do this step thus requires us to keep track of those words within the phrase which have been validated. We can do so with a simple list."
