    "Note that when a sentence contains a clause which contains a phrase, \n",
    "the sentence, clause, and phrase are linked to slot sets that contain each other.\n",

    "Later in this notebook we'll show a frequency list of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a description of what we do with the mother relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a *clause* has a mother, there are three cases for the `rela` value of this clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. its value is in $\\{$ ``Adju``, ``Objc``, ``Subj``, ``PrAd``, ``PreC``, ``Cmpl``, ``Attr``, ``RgRc``, ``Spec`` $\\}$\n",
    "2. its value is ``Coor``\n",
    "3. its value is in $\\{$ ``Resu``, ``ReVo``, ``none`` $\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In case 3 we do nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case 1 we remove the link of the clause to its parent \n",
    "and add the clause as a child to either the node\n",
    "that the mother points to, or to the parent of the mother. \n",
    "We do the latter only if the mother is a word.\n",
    "We will not add children to words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagrams, the red arrows represent the mother relationship, \n",
    "and the black arrows the embedding relationships, \n",
    "and the fat black arrows the new parent relationships. \n",
    "The gray arrows indicated severed parent links.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/TreesCase1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In case 2 we create a node between the mother and its parent.\n",
    "This node takes the name of the mother, and the mother will be added as child, \n",
    "but with name ``Ccoor``, and the clause which points to the mother is added as a sister.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a rather complicated case, but the intuition is not that difficult. \n",
    "Consider the sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "    John thinks that Mary said it and did it\n",
    "   \n",
    "We have a compound object sentence, with ``Mary said it`` and ``did it`` as coordinated components.\n",
    "The way this has been marked up in the BHSA database is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``Mary said it``, clause with ``clause_constituent_relation``=``Objc``, ``mother``=``John thinks``(clause)\n",
    "\n",
    "``and did it``, clause with ``clause_constituent_relation``=``Coor``, ``mother``=``Mary said it``(clause)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the second coordinated clause is simply linked to the first coordinated clause. \n",
    "Restructuring means to create a parent for both coordinated clauses \n",
    "and treat both as sisters at the same hierarchical level. \n",
    "See the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/TreesCase2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on order\n",
    "When we add nodes to new parents, we let them occupy the sequential position \n",
    "among its new sisters that corresponds with the slot set ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on discontinuity\n",
    "Sentences, clauses and phrases are not always continuous. \n",
    "Before restructuring it will not always be the case that if you\n",
    "walk the tree in pre-order, you will end up with the leaves (the words) \n",
    "in the same order as the original sentence.\n",
    "Restructuring generally improves that, because it often puts \n",
    "a node under a non-continuous parent object precisely at the location \n",
    "that corresponds with the a gap in the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is no guarantee that every discontinuity will be resolved in this graceful manner.\n",
    "When we create the trees, we also output the list of slot numbers \n",
    "that you get when you walk the tree in pre-order.\n",
    "Whenever this list is not monotonic, there is an issue with the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on cycles\n",
    "If a mother points to itself or a descendant of itself, we have a cycle in the mother relationship. \n",
    "In these cases, the restructuring algorithm will disconnect a parent link \n",
    "without introducing a new link to the tree above it: \n",
    "a whole fragment of the tree becomes disconnected and will get lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sanity check 6 below reveals that this occurs in fact 4 times in the BHSA version 4 \n",
    "(it occurred 13 times in the BHSA 3 version). \n",
    "We will exclude these trees from further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on stretch\n",
    "If a mother points outside the sentence of the clause \n",
    "on which it is specified we have a case of stretch.\n",
    "This should not happen. Mothers may point outside their sentences, \n",
    "but not in the cases that trigger restructuring.\n",
    "Yet, the sanity checks below reveal that this does occur in some versions. \n",
    "We will exclude these cases from further processing."
