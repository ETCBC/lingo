    "The BHSA data is coded in such a way that every object is associated with a *type* and a *monad set*. \n",

    "The *type* of an object, $T(O)$, determines which features an object has. ETCBC types are ``sentence``, ``sentence_atom``,\n",
    "``clause``, ``clause_atom``, ``phrase``, ``phrase_atom``, ``subphrase``, ``word``.\n",

    "The *monad set* of an object, $m(O)$, is the set of word occurrences contained by that object.\n",
    "Every word occurrence in the source has a unique sequence number, so monad sets are sets of sequence numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that\n",
    "when a sentence contains a clause which contains a phrase, the sentence, clause, and phrase contain words directly as monad sets. The fact that a sentence contains a clause is not marked directly, it is a consequence of the monad set embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition (monad set order):\n",
    "There is a natural order on monad sets, following the intuition that monad sets with smaller elements come before monad set with bigger elements, and embedding monad sets come before embedded monad sets.\n",
    "Hence, if you enumerate a set of objects that happens to constitute a tree hierarchy based on monad set embedding, and you enumerate those objects in the monad set order, you will walk the tree in pre-order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This order is a modification of the one as described in (Doedens 1994, 3.6.3).\n",
    "<img src=\"images/DoedensLO.png\"/>\n",
    "> Doedens, Crist-Jan (1994), *Text Databases. One Database Model and Several Retrieval Languages*, number 14 in Language and Computers, Editions Rodopi, Amsterdam, Netherlands and Atlanta, USA. ISBN: 90-5183-729-1, http://books.google.nl/books?id=9ggOBRz1dO4C.\n",
    "The order as defined by Doedens corresponds to walking trees in post-order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a lot of processing, it is handy to have a the stack of embedding elements available when working with an element. That is the advantage of pre-order over post-order. It is very much like SAX parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is as the formal definition of my order:\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_1 < m_2$ if either of the following holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $m_2 \\subset m_1$ (note that the embedder comes first!)\n",
    "1. $m_1 \\not\\subset m_2 \\wedge m_2 \\not\\subset m_1 \\wedge \\min(m_1 \\setminus m_2) < \\min(m_2 \\setminus m_1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not base our trees on *all* object types, since in the BHSA data they do not constitute a single hierarchy.\n",
    "We will restrict ourselves to the set $\\cal O = \\{$ ``sentence``, ``clause``, ``phrase``, ``word`` $\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition (directly below):\n",

    "While using the embedding got us trees, using the mother relationship will give us more interesting trees.\n",
    "In general, the *mother* in the ETCBC points to an object on which the object in question is, in some sense, dependent.\n",
    "The nature of this dependency is coded in a specific feature on clauses, the ``clause_constituent_relation``.\n",

    "Here is a description of what we do with the mother relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a *clause* has a mother, there are three cases for the *clause_constituent_relation* of this clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. its value is in $\\{$ ``Adju``, ``Objc``, ``Subj``, ``PrAd``, ``PreC``, ``Cmpl``, ``Attr``, ``RgRc``, ``Spec`` $\\}$\n",
    "2. its value is ``Coor``\n",
    "3. its value is in $\\{$ ``Resu``, ``ReVo``, ``none`` $\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In case 3 we do nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case 1 we remove the link of the clause to its parent and add the clause as a child to either the object that the mother\n",
    "points to, or to the parent of the mother. We do the latter only if the mother is a word. We will not add children to words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagrams, the red arrows represent the mother relationship, and the black arrows the embedding relationships, and the fat black arrows the new parent relationships. The gray arrows indicated severed parent links.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/TreesCase1.pdf\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In case 2 we create a node between the mother and its parent.\n",
    "This node takes the name of the mother, and the mother will be added as child, but with name ``Ccoor``, and the clause which points to the mother is added as a sister.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a rather complicated case, but the intuition is not that difficult. Consider the sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "    John thinks that Mary said it and did it\n",
    "   \n",
    "We have a compound object sentence, with ``Mary said it`` and ``did it`` as coordinated components.\n",
    "The way this has been marked up in the BHSA database is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``Mary said it``, clause with ``clause_constituent_relation``=``Objc``, ``mother``=``John thinks``(clause)\n",
    "\n",
    "``and did it``, clause with ``clause_constituent_relation``=``Coor``, ``mother``=``Mary said it``(clause)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the second coordinated clause is simply linked to the first coordinated clause. Restructuring means to create a parent for both coordinated clauses and treat both as sisters at the same hierarchical level. See the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/TreesCase2.pdf\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on order\n",
    "When we add nodes to new parents, we let them occupy the sequential position among its new sisters that corresponds with the monad set ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on discontinuity\n",
    "Sentences, clauses and phrases are not always continuous. Before restructuring it will not always be the case that if you\n",
    "walk the tree in pre-order, you will end up with the leaves (the words) in the same order as the original sentence.\n",
    "Restructuring generally improves that, because it often puts an object under a non-continuous parent object precisely at the location that corresponds with the a gap in the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is no guarantee that every discontinuity will be resolved in this graceful manner.\n",
    "When we create the trees, we also output the list of monad numbers that you get when you walk the tree in pre-order.\n",
    "Whenever this list is not monotonic, there is an issue with the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on incest\n",
    "If a mother points to itself or a descendant of itself, we have a grave form of incest. In these cases, the restructuring algorithm will disconnect a parent link without introducing a new link to the tree above it: a whole fragment of the tree becomes disconnected and will get lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sanity check 6 below reveals that this occurs in fact 4 times in the BHSA version 4 (it occurred 13 times in the BHSA \n",
    "3 version). \n",
    "We will exclude these trees from further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on adultery\n",
    "If a mother points outside the sentence of the clause on which it is specified we have a form of adultery.\n",
    "This should not happen. Mothers may point outside their sentences, but not in the cases that trigger restructuring.\n",
    "Yet, the sanity checks below reveal that this occurs twice. We will exclude these cases from further processing."
